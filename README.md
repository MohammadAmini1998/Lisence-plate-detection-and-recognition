## License Plate Detection and Recognition Project
### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system for detecting license plates and recognizing characters on them in both images and videos. The project is divided into three main sections:

License Plate Detection in Images
License Plate and Character Recognition in Images
License Plate and Character Recognition in Videos
YOLOv5 for Object Detection
For the object detection tasks in this project, we will be using YOLOv5, which stands for "You Only Look Once." YOLOv5 is the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection system, which is known for its real-time object detection capabilities.

Key Features of YOLOv5:
State-of-the-art Performance: YOLOv5 offers significant improvements in both accuracy and speed compared to its predecessors.
Real-time Object Detection: YOLOv5 is capable of real-time object detection, making it suitable for various applications, including this license plate detection and recognition project.
Easy to Use and Implement: YOLOv5 is easy to use and implement, making it an excellent choice for object detection tasks for both images and videos.
